I am a computer science major at CSUF

### Some labs I have done in the past:

**Lab 3, Part 2**

>I really enjoyed this part of the lab because it was quite lengthy at the time and seeing it work was awesome.  
>This lab also helped us understand how to write functions and call them.  It was also cool to be able to turn 
>two dates into a Julian date and give the difference between them. 

**Lab 4, Part 1**

>I liked this lab because it was somewhat challenging at the time.  
>I also believe this is the first time we started to implement header files into our labs as well as calling 
>functions.  The program itself is also helpful since it converts milliliters into other measurements. 

**Lab 5, Part 2**

>This lab was interesting to me because we got to use the trunc() function and static_cast to convert doubles
>into integers.  We also had to check to see if we could convert by using std::numeric_limits<int>::max() and
>std::numeric_limits<int>::min().  This was needed in order to convert a given decimal number into a number 
>with a fraction.
